## The Problem

Job applications are the same 20 questions on 47 different forms.
Nobody has time for that. Nobody should have to.

---

## The Solution

A Chrome extension that:
1. **Stores your profile locally** once (resume, defaults, safe memory)
2. **Detects job application forms** automatically
3. **Reads the JD** from the page or pasted text
4. **Generates tailored answers** per role using your own Gemini API key
5. **Keeps you in review** before filling the form in place

**Local-first. Review-first. Private. Fast.**

---

## Quick Start (< 5 minutes)

1. Clone this repo (or download as ZIP)
2. Open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select the repo folder
4. Click the 🤖 icon → paste your [free Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and leave the model on **Auto**
5. Upload your resume (PDF, DOCX, or paste text)
6. Navigate to a job page → click the icon → **Fill Form**

## CSV Import for Tracker History

Use **Tracker → Import CSV** to bring in past applications from another sheet or export.
Accepted headers are case-insensitive and can include:

- `Company`
- `Role Title` / `Title`
- `Status`
- `Date`
- `Employment Type`
- `Remote`
- `Location`
- `Salary Range`
- `Pay Min`
- `Pay Max`
- `Scorecard`
- `Verdict`
- `URL`
- `Notes`

Example header row:

```csv
Company,Role Title,Status,Date,Employment Type,Remote,Location,Pay Min,Pay Max,Scorecard,Verdict,URL,Notes
```

## Tech Stack

- **Chrome MV3** extension
- **Auto-selected Gemini 2.5 models** via REST API (`models.list` + fallback strategy)
- Data is stored locally in `chrome.storage.local`; external requests only go to the Gemini API using your key.  

- Zero dependencies, zero build step — just load and use

---

## Storage Schema

```json
{
  "resume": {
    "structured": { "name": "", "email": "", "skills": [], "experience": [], ... },
    "excerpt": "plain-text excerpt/preview (≤1000 chars, including uploaded file/data-URL resumes)"
  },
  "settings": {
    "gemini_api_key": "...",
    "preferred_salary_min": 150000,
    "preferred_salary_max": 325000,
    "work_authorization": "US Citizen",
    "preferred_remote": true
  },
  "applications": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "company": "Anthropic",
      "title": "IT Systems Engineer",
      "url": "...",
      "status": "submitted",
      "date": "2026-04-04",
      "pay_min": 150000,
      "pay_max": 230000,
      "jd_snippet": "...",
      "answers_generated": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Privacy

- Your resume and API key are stored **only** in your local browser storage.
- External network calls happen **only** for actions you trigger (AI help with your Gemini key; optional job-search sources / LinkedIn profile import with your own credentials).
- No servers, no accounts, no telemetry.

See **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)** for the full Terms of Use (EULA), Privacy Policy, Security posture, and your GDPR/CCPA data rights — the same content shown in the app's **Help & privacy** panel.

---

## Development

All checks run via Docker — no local Node.js required.

```bash
# Unit tests (63 tests, no browser needed)
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml run --rm test

# Lint
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml run --rm lint

# E2E (Playwright, requires headed or CI browser)
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml run --rm e2e

# Coverage
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml run --rm coverage
```

**Pre-commit hooks** (lint on commit, tests on push):
```bash
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```
